# Digital_Systems_Design_Project
In this repository, you will find my work for the 'Digital Systems Design' course, undertaken during the second semester of my first year at the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca.

Contained within this repository is the complete project, featuring both comprehensive project documentation and the VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language) code. This project, titled 'Variable Illumination System,' serves as a practical application of the principles and concepts introduced in the course, providing valuable insights into the realm of hardware design and digital systems.
